What are the benefits of having multiple branches?\nThe main benefit of having multiple branches is that you can set one branch to be your "live" branch that the consumer sees. You can set an alternate branch to be the main branch that you develop new changes for instead of jeopardizing the main branch. \n\n3.

GitHub takes a local repository and makes it remote to make it avaliable to other developers to work on the same projects. \n')])])]),o("p",[e._v("Day 2:\n1.

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?\n    \n    Specificity is more or less \"importance\" in the code. For example, if you have an object with both the color red and the color blue applied to it, if the color red has a higher specificity, the object will be red instead of blue.\n\n3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?\n    I think one of the issues you could run into is that if everything is listed as !important then nothing becomes important or they all fight constantly over dominance and it could cause a lot of specificity issues in your code.\n")])])]),o("p",[e._v("Day 3:\n1.

Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.\nI always look for good color palette websites as apposed to just color pickers because it gives you a full palette to work with.

LF is useful for quick ideas and general placement, and high fidelity is useful for very accurate and very clear near-finished level of visaul development. Mid-fidelity would act as a middle point between the two.\n\n3.Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?\n    Wireframing is a lot like doing thumbnail sketching for art, in my opinion, which ultimately is required for higher complexity illustrations or for figuring out your ideas. I don't see why you wouldn't at least do a basic low-fidelity wireframing if you have the time. \n")])])])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=a.exports}}]);
